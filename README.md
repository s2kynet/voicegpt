- Python installed on your computer.
- The required Python libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`. See the [Installation](#installation) section for details.
- An OpenAI API key if you want to use the GPT-3.5 model. You can obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform.

## Installation

To install the required Python libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pyaudio
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install playsound
pip install gTTS
pip install openai
pip install pyautogui
pip install pytesseract

## Usage
Run the Python Script:
python voice_assistant.py

Initiate Voice Commands:

Begin a voice command by saying your wake word (e.g., "Hey Rex").
Follow the voice assistant's prompts to perform tasks such as taking notes, responding to specific commands, and capturing screenshots.
Say "stop" to terminate the voice assistant.
Customization
You can customize and extend the voice assistant's functionality by modifying the Python code. You can add new voice commands, change responses, or adjust the behavior as needed.

## Troubleshooting
Ensure that your microphone is properly connected and configured for speech recognition.
Verify your OpenAI API key is correct and properly configured.
